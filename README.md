Outcome 2.3 Assessment - Project for Client
========================

    On completion of this unit the student should be able to work collaboratively and apply the problemsolving
    methodology to create an ICT solution, taking into account client feedback.
    
        By working in teams, which can be virtual, to solve information problems for known clients, students 
        develop an understanding of how constraints imposed by clients (users) affect the techniques and 
        procedures applied when creating solutions. Individual team members prepare designs for the 
        solutions and collectively they consider the designs and select one, based on agreed criteria, and make 
        adjustments, if appropriate. These designs are considered by the clients, who provide feedback to the 
        teams. Any modifications suggested by the clients are incorporated into the designs. Each student in a 
        team can then individually follow the final design and develop the entire solution, or each student can 
        contribute to the completion of the teamâ€™s solutions. This involves using techniques and procedures 
        to efficiently and effectively process and manage data, information and files. Team members record 
        and monitor progress through shared electronic files. Students do not have to use dedicated project 
        management software.
        
        A client-based approach provides the opportunity for students to develop and apply, in real situations, 
        knowledge and understanding about criteria for evaluating the efficiency of processing and the 
        effectiveness of solutions, as identified in the solution designs.

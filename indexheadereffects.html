            <p>At the present time, eminent breeders try by methodical
            selection, with a distinct object in view, to make a new strain or
            sub-breed, superior to anything of the kind in the country. But,
            for our purpose, a form of selection, which may be called
            unconscious, and which results from every one trying to possess and
            breed from the best individual animals, is more important. Thus, a
            man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good
            dogs as he can, and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs, but
            he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed.
            Nevertheless we may infer that this process, continued during
            centuries, would improve and modify any breed, in the same way as
            Bakewell, Collins, etc., by this very same process, only carried on
            more methodically, did greatly modify, even during their lifetimes,
            the forms and qualities of their cattle. Slow and insensible
            changes of this kind could never be recognised unless actual
            measurements or careful drawings of the breeds in question have
            been made long ago, which may serve for comparison. In some cases,
            however, unchanged, or but little changed, individuals of the same
            breed exist in less civilised districts, where the breed has been
            less improved. There is reason to believe that King Charles'
            spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent since the
            time of that monarch. Some highly competent authorities are
            convinced that the setter is directly derived from the spaniel, and
            has probably been slowly altered from it. It is known that the
            English pointer has been greatly changed within the last century,
            and in this case the change has, it is believed, been chiefly
            effected by crosses with the foxhound; but what concerns us is,
            that the change has been effected unconsciously and gradually, and
            yet so effectually that, though the old Spanish pointer certainly
            came from Spain, Mr. Borrow has not seen, as I am informed by him,
            any native dog in Spain like our pointer.</p>


            <p>By a similar process of selection, and by careful training,
            English race-horses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the
            parent Arabs, so that the latter, by the regulations for the
            Goodwood Races, are favoured in the weights which they carry. Lord
            Spencer and others have shown how the cattle of England have
            increased in weight and in early maturity, compared with the stock
            formerly kept in this country. By comparing the accounts given in
            various old treatises of the former and present state of carrier
            and tumbler pigeons in Britain, India, and Persia, we can trace the
            stages through which they have insensibly passed, and come to
            differ so greatly from the rock-pigeon.</p>


            <p>Youatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a
            course of selection which may be considered as unconscious, in so
            far that the breeders could never have expected, or even wished, to
            produce the result which ensued—namely, the production of the
            distinct strains. The two flocks of Leicester sheep kept by Mr.
            Buckley and Mr. Burgess, as Mr. Youatt remarks, "Have been purely
            bred from the original stock of Mr. Bakewell for upwards of fifty
            years. There is not a suspicion existing in the mind of any one at
            all acquainted with the subject that the owner of either of them
            has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of Mr.
            Bakewell's flock, and yet the difference between the sheep
            possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the
            appearance of being quite different varieties."</p>


            <p>If there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the
            inherited character of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet
            any one animal particularly useful to them, for any special
            purpose, would be carefully preserved during famines and other
            accidents, to which savages are so liable, and such choice animals
            would thus generally leave more offspring than the inferior ones;
            so that in this case there would be a kind of unconscious selection
            going on. We see the value set on animals even by the barbarians of
            Tierra del Fuego, by their killing and devouring their old women,
            in times of dearth, as of less value than their dogs.</p>
